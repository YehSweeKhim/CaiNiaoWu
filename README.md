## Introduction
菜鸟屋 is a portable shelf add-on that helps to arrange the parcels at 菜鸟驿站 with the use of an app to store the parcel location and dividers to compact the parcels neatly on the shelves. The divider at the customer’s parcel location will light up on collection, making it convenient for the customers to find their parcel without having to rummage through the shelves. In addition, it helps the workers to effortlessly compact the parcels in an orderly arrangement.

## 菜鸟屋 App
### Framework
To create our mobile application, we used Android Studio to leverage on existing hardware since the workers at the parcel station uses a barcode scanner device that allows the installation of android applications and they could also use their mobile phones. Apart from that, Android Studio offers the easier creation of interactive UIs and their structured code modules allow us to divide our project into units of functionality that can independently build, test, and debug.
